# Neovim CONFIG

Neovim config using [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as the package manager.

## Deprecated functions

Since nvim is a living and thriving ecosystem, I suggest to run the following
command from time to time, in order to prevent lost of capabilities:

```vim
:checkhealt vim.deprecated
```
